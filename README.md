# 2D-Kalman-Filter
This was one assignment in the course Statistical Parameter Estimation. In the assignment I implemented 2D Kalman Filter for Gaussian random walk process and spring mass system such as 2D extended Kalman Filter for pendulum model. The exercises for the assignment are from the book:
Sarkka, S. (2013). Bayesian filtering and smoothing. Institute of Mathematical Statistics textbooks ; 3. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.

The code can be found from the MATLAB file and written report from the pdf-file.
